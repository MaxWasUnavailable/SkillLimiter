title=Skill Limiter
description=This mod adds a skill cap based on your profession and traits.
description=
description=There are 4 "tiers" of skill caps, dependent on the total level added by your profession and traits.
description=
description=Tier 1 | 0 levels added | level 5 skill cap
description=Tier 2 | 1 level added | Level 7 skill cap
description=Tier 3 | 2 levels added | Level 9 skill cap
description=Tier 4 | 3 or more levels added | Level 10 skill cap
description=
description=Now featuring a sandbox options menu to configure starting tiers for each skill category!
description=Defaults are set up so that passives (strength / fitness) are uncapped, crafting / survivalist skills start at tier 1, and other skill categories start at tier 2 or 3. This is fully configurable.
description=
description=Big update time!
description=You can now change the different skill caps (For example, set Tier 1 to cap at Level 3, or set all tiers except for Tier 4 to cap at level 8)!
description=Additionally, multi-language support should properly work now. (As in, the mod shouldn't break if you're not using English)
description=And, last but not least, you can now add custom tier bonuses to individual skills! An example default setting is set up to add a bonus of 0 to 3 skills, showcasing how to format the option. The perk names in this setting need to match the code's perk IDs, which you can find here:  https://projectzomboid.com/modding/zombie/characters/skills/PerkFactory.Perks.html

description=The mod plays nicely with other mods that dynamically add and remove traits. Do beware that lost traits will result in a player's skills being reduced to the new tier!
